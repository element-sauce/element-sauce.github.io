            <strong>Description:</strong>
            The Fledger's website is an online independent news website that aims to give a distinct voice to young adults and the topics they care about.
            It features a visually appealing bulletin board followed by a more detailed opinion section, and a guides section at the bottom.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tasteful application of text size contrast to emphasize bulletin board poster headlines and appropriate large text size for headings</li>
                    <li>Good contrast of text color and background color makes text easy and fun to read </li>
                    <li>Good use of different font styles to create distinction in different sections of the homepage</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subsections of the website use consistent choices of font, such as the titles in the Most Popular subsection, and the menu bar</li>
                    <li>Repetition of general bulletin poster style: Rectangular shaped, with a solid color background, headline, and image</li>
                    <li>Quote text in the detailed Opinion section uses the same font</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Opinion section has its elements aligned with equal margins on both sides that are slightly larger than the previous sections,
                        creating a sense of organization that distinguishs different sections of the website from each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>The header of the website has its elements consistently aligned: the stack and search icons are spaced the same as the pen and profile icons.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>All of the bulletin board posters are grouped together in the same area.</li>
                    <li>The opinion quotations are grouped together in the same area.</li>
                    <li>The guide cards are in the same area.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Overall assessment:</strong> 
            In general, The Fledger's website follows CRAP design principles well. The website features consistent styling and also establishes contrast to create emphasis
            when appropriate. Reasonable alignment and proximity choices are made.
        </p>

            <strong>Description: </strong>
            Vapor95's website is an online vaporwave fashion brand and clothing store based in Los Angeles, that aims to faciliate the
            expression of aestheticism into wearable works of art. It features an eye-catching animation banner followed by an abundance of clothing listings.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The product title, reviews, and story section of the home page feature small text that can be hard to read, while the header text is 
                        much larger in size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Large text in the main section graphics provides good emphasis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The product listings in different sections use different styles of organization, for instance,
                        the first set of listings use a grid, but a subsequent section, requires the use of small arrow buttons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Buttons have consistent styling.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The small arrow buttons to navigate a set of product listings is small and awkwardly aligned the right side of the window.</li>
                    <li>The second set of listings has each product square of the same size, but other product listings are of different sizes,
                        causing the alignment of the options and add to cart button to be displaced in an awkward fashion.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The proximity of good overall. The product listings are clearly in the same vicinity of each other.</li>
                    <li>The long nature of the home page might be inconvenient for some users who wish to view the product listings within a more
                        clearly defined interface.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Overall assessment: </strong> 
            Vapor95's website succeeds in certain areas, but also fails to meet certain CRAP design principles, so in general, it does not follow its principles particularly well.
            Its adherence to proximity is fair, but it lacks in areas like alignment and makes a few dubious contrast choices.
